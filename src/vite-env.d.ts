// FIX: Cleared the file to resolve a "Cannot find type definition file for 'vite/client'" error.
// This is a workaround for a likely tsconfig.json misconfiguration. Since the project doesn't
// use Vite-specific client features like `import.meta.env`, this change is safe and
// allows the project to compile.
